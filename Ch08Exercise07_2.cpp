//--- ignore/ internal notes only ---
//Switch to dynamic arrays for more flexibility with number of candidates--flexible--memory efficient--scalable solutions
// User-specified number of candidates
// Dynamic memory allocation with new[]
// Same logic works for any array size  
// Memory cleanup with delete[]
// Input validation for positive candidate count
// Flexible for any election size (3 candidates to 50)
//Ask user for number of candidates
//Replace static arrays with dynamic allocation
//Change all 5 to numCandidates in loops
//Add memory cleanup at the end
//I got too many annoying assignments pulling me from converting my epic banking system into modern fortran and its distracting.
