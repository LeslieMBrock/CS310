/* I modified this from number of pennies in a coin to a real world application of basically how a coin star might work, because who is asking for pennies back and I had to cash in my change today. I thought we got rid of the penny, and I got lost down the rabbit hole trying to recreate a receipt and this was as close as I could get because the no css in programming. I only used the iomanip library for formatting. I'm trying to use as less code as possible, so, why add a string, another lib, when we can use different features of the existing libraries? */

    // the double doesn't matter if its at the top, and because the other two parts have to happen first, we can declare it here, and then just do the clalculation using the convential = and - in the same line, can declare variables anywhere, but cant use them before.//
