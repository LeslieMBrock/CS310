# Description: This program demonstrates the Normal Order Evaluation problem
# in recursive factorial functions and implements memoization as a solution.
# PROBLEM: Normal Order Evaluation causes redundant calculations
# - factorial(5) calculates: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1*0!
# - Later factorial(3) recalculates: 3*2*1*0! (redundant work!)
#
# SOLUTION: Memoization - cache previously calculated results

# Dictionary to store previously calculated factorial results (the cache!)

#--- ignore these--inetranl notes only ---
# NORMAL ORDER EVALUATION PROBLEM:
# - Recursive functions recalculate same values repeatedly
# - factorial(5) then factorial(3) = redundant calculations for 3,2,1,0

# this is the same friggin issue as the ch10 exercise_take 7 with the input handling--wtf? The world is a small place.

#The solution is caching/memoization to avoid redundant work
#getcin() from C is like input() in Python, both read from standard input

#Avoid redundant computation through intelligent caching/storage
#This applies to: Recursive functions (Python factorial memoization) Object creation (C++ banking system efficiency) Input buffer management (cin.get() vs getch() handling) Database queries (cache results instead of re-querying) Web requests (cache API responses)  Graphics rendering (cache textures instead of reloading)



# MEMOIZATION SOLUTION:
# - Cache previously calculated results in dictionary
# - Check cache before calculating - return cached value if exists
# - Dramatically improves efficiency for repeated calculations
# 
# EXAMPLE: factorial(3) called twice
# - Original: 6 total calculations (3*2*1 + 3*2*1)  
# - Memoized: 3 calculations first time, 0 second time (uses cache)--I smell Parallelism here.
# Memoization + parallelism = advanced optimization
#Add memoization to eliminate redundant factorial calculations
