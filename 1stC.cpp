    Of course\! That's a creative set of requirements. Here is a C++ program that incorporates all those ideas and includes the two intentional errors needed for your assignment.

### C++ Code with Two Errors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// This function is supposed to add numbers but has an error
int calculateValue(int a, int b)
{
    // ERROR 1: This function should return an integer, but it's returning a string.
    return "we are coming back";
}

int main()
{
    int result = calculateValue(7540, 0);

    // ERROR 2: This line tries to print a variable 'finalResult' that was never declared.
    std::cout << finalResult << std::endl;

    // This fulfills the requirement to return 7541 from the program
    return 7541;
}

int main() { 
    //week1();//comment out to run without// 
    //week2();// comment out to run without//
    //week3();//comment out to run without//
    //week4();//comment out to run without//
}
    return 0;
